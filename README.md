# Odin Recipes
## Description
This website was made as the solution to the project proposed at the end of the html section of the **Foundations** course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com),
with the purpose of practicing and reenforcing several foundational html5 concepts presented up to this point in the course, such as:
- Elements and tags
- Basic structure and boilerplate of an html file
- How to work with text
- Ordered and Unordered lists
- Links and images
- Basic structure of a webpage and website

The website itself consists of an homepage with a main heading, 1 image and a list of 3 links to 3 different recipe webpages. Each recipe page contains: a main heading,
1 image of the respective recipe, a small description, a list of the necessary ingredients and the step by step instructions for reproducing it.
