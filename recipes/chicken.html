        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless, skinless <strong>chicken breasts</strong></li>
            <li>8 oz fresh <strong>mozzarella</strong>, sliced</li>
            <li>2 large ripe <strong>tomatoes</strong>, sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh <strong>basil leaves</strong></li>
            <li>2 tablespoons <strong>balsamic glaze</strong> (store-bought or homemade)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons <strong>olive oil</strong></li>
            <li>2 cloves <strong>garlic</strong>, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried <strong>oregano</strong></li>
            <li><strong></strong>Salt and <strong>pepper</strong> to taste</li>
            <li><strong>Toothpicks</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a baking dish large enough to fit the chicken breasts in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Butterfly the chicken breasts: Lay each breast flat on a cutting board, and using a sharp knife, slice horizontally through the center, stopping just short of cutting through the other side. Open the breast like a book, so it lays flat and resembles a butterfly.</li>
            <li>Season the inside of each butterflied chicken breast with salt, pepper, and dried oregano.</li>
            <li>Layer each chicken breast with fresh mozzarella, sliced tomatoes, and fresh basil leaves. Drizzle a little balsamic glaze over the filling.</li>
            <li>Carefully fold the chicken breast closed, tucking in any fillings that try to escape. Secure the chicken with toothpicks to hold everything together.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix the olive oil and minced garlic. Brush this garlic oil mixture over the top of each stuffed chicken breast.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Sear each chicken breast for about 2 minutes on each side until lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Transfer the seared chicken breasts to the greased baking dish and bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Remove the toothpicks before serving. Drizzle a little more balsamic glaze over the top if desired, and garnish with fresh basil leaves for an extra touch of elegance.</li>
            <li>Serve your Caprese Stuffed Chicken with a side of your favorite pasta or a fresh green salad, and savor the delightful blend of Mediterranean flavors. Buon appetito!</li>
