        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>20 medium-sized <strong>white mushrooms</strong></li>
            <li>1 cup <strong>cream cheese</strong>, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded <strong>cheddar cheese</strong></li>
            <li>1/2 cup cooked <strong>bacon</strong>, crumbled</li>
            <li>2 cloves <strong>garlic</strong>, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh <strong>parsley</strong>, chopped</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong> and <strong>pepper</strong> to taste</li>
            <li><strong>Olive oil</strong> for brushing</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the stems from the mushrooms and set them aside. Brush the mushroom caps with olive oil and place them on the baking sheet, cap side down.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the cream cheese, cheddar cheese, crumbled bacon, minced garlic, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well until everything is evenly incorporated.</li>
            <li>Stuff each mushroom cap generously with the cheese and bacon mixture, using a spoon or your fingers to press it down firmly.</li>
            <li>Finely chop the reserved mushroom stems and sprinkle them over the stuffed mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown on top.</li>
            <li>Let the mushrooms cool slightly before serving. They taste best when warm and gooey!</li>
        </ol>
